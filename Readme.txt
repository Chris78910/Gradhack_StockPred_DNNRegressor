The Entrance of function is 'stock_prediction.py', 'weight-10000eps' is weight file for model, 'forward-sample3' is the current data for predicting input

we have a list of 286 choices, but in demo day I only suggest the four I pick(sometimes the output is weired for the abnormal data input)
(TEL,RTN,TXN,T)

currently, we need to type in the stock name, but when integrated we can make it into a function to call

no other things need to modified, DNNRegression.py is for training, model_validtion is for data visiualiztion for demo day presentation, 
which can neglect when integrating it into app.
